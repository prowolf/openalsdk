LICENSE
1.  Grant of License
    The Software is licensed, not sold, to you for use only under the terms of this Agreement.  This License Agreement is your proof of license to exercise the rights granted herein and must be retained by you.  As between you and Creative (and, to the extent applicable, its licensors), Creative retains all title to and ownership of the Software and reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

You may not allow the Software or its functions to be accessed remotely, or transmit all or any portion of the Software through any network or communication line.

4.  Copyright
    The Software is owned by Creative and/or its licensors, and is protected by United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  You may not remove the copyright notice from any copy of the Software or any copy of the written materials, if any, accompanying the Software.

9.  Limitations on Using and Copying the Software
    Except to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement or by any other developer agreement agreed to in writing by Creative, you may not use nor copy the Software for any purpose other than software development.  Nor may you sub-license any of your rights under this Agreement.  You may use the Software for your personal use only, and absent a written agreement with Creative to the contrary, not for public performance or for the creation of publicly displayed videotapes.

10. Decompiling, Disassembling, or Reverse Engineering
    You acknowledge that the Software contains trade secrets and other proprietary information of Creative and its licensors.  Except to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement or by the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located, you may not decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Software, or engage in any other activities to obtain underlying information that is not visible to the user in connection with normal use of the Software.
    In particular, you agree not to transmit the Software or display the Software's object code for any purpose on any computer screen or to make any hardcopy memory dumps for any purpose of the Software's object code.  If you believe you require information related to the interoperability of the Software with other programs, you shall not decompile or disassemble the Software to obtain such information, and you agree to request such information from Creative at the address listed below.  Upon receiving such a request, Creative shall determine whether you require such information for a legitimate purpose and, if so, Creative will provide such information to you within a reasonable time and on reasonable conditions.
    In any event, you will notify Creative of any information derived from reverse engineering or such other activities, and the results thereof will constitute the confidential information of Creative that may be used only in connection with the Software.

TERMINATION
    The license granted to you is effective until terminated. You may terminate it at any time by destroying the Software (including any portions or copies thereof) currently in your possession or control.  The license will also terminate automatically without any notice from Creative if you fail to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement.  You agree upon any such termination to destroy the Software (including any portions or copies thereof).  Upon termination, Creative may also enforce any and all rights provided by law.  The provisions of this Agreement that protect the proprietary rights of Creative will continue in force after termination.

NO WARRANTY
    ANY USE BY YOU OF THE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED FOR USE ONLY WITH CREATIVE'S HARDWARE AND RELATED SOFTWARE. THE  SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED FOR USE "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE  MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CREATIVE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF  ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED  WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  PURPOSE, TITLE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.  CREATIVE IS NOT OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE ANY UPDATES OR UPGRADES TO THE SOFTWARE.

    No distributor, dealer or any other entity or person is authorized to expand or alter this warranty or any other provisions of this Agreement.  Creative does not warrant that the functions contained in the Software will meet your requirements or that the operation of the Software will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free from malicious code.  For purposes of this paragraph, �malicious code� means any program code designed to contaminate other computer programs or computer data, consume computer resources, modify, destroy, record, or transmit data, or in some other fashion usurp the normal operation of the computer, computer system, or computer network, including viruses, Trojan horses, droppers, worms, spyware, logic bombs, and the like.

    Further, Creative shall not be liable for the accuracy of any information provided by Creative or third-party technical support personnel, or any damages caused, either directly or indirectly, by acts taken or omissions made by you as a result of such technical support.

    Any representation, other than the warranties set forth in this Agreement, will not bind Creative.  You assume full responsibility for the selection of the Software to achieve your intended results, and for the downloading, use and results obtained from the Software.  You also assume the entire risk as it applies to the quality and performance of the Software.  Should the Software prove defective, you (and not Creative, or its distributors or dealers) assume the entire liability of any and all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

    This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights, which vary from country/state to country/state.  Some countries/states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.  Creative disclaims all warranties of any kind if the Software was customized, repackaged, or altered in any way by any third party other than Creative.

    IN NO EVENT WILL CREATIVE'S LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON EVER EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO USE THE SOFTWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE CLAIM.

NO LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
    In no event shall Creative or its Licensor's be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, incidental, direct, indirect, special or consequential damages, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use or inability to use this Software, even if Creative or its Licensor's have been advised of the possibility of such damages.  Because some states/ countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.

INDEMNIFICATION BY YOU
    If you distribute the Software in violation of this Agreement, you hereby indemnify, hold harmless and defend Creative from and against any and all claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees and costs that arise, result from, or are connected with the use or distribution of the Software in violation of this Agreement.

U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS

Use, duplication or disclosure by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in subdivision (b)(3)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software Clause at 252.227-7013.

If you believe you require information related to the interoperability of the Software with other programs, you shall not decompile or disassemble the Software to obtain such information, and you agree to request such information from Creative at the address listed above.  Upon receiving such a request, Creative shall determine whether you require such information for a legitimate purpose and, if so, Creative will provide such information to you within a reasonable time and on reasonable conditions.

Limited Warranty:
    EXCEPT AS STATED ABOVE IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND AS PROVIDED BELOW UNDER THE HEADING "STATUTORY RIGHTS," THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS-IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Irish Statutory rights:
    Irish law provides that certain conditions and warranties may be implied in contracts for the sale of goods and in contracts for the supply of services.  Such conditions and warranties are hereby excluded, to the extent such exclusion, in the context of this transaction, is lawful under Irish law.  Conversely, such conditions and warranties, insofar as they may not be lawfully excluded, shall apply.  Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement shall prejudice any rights that you may enjoy by virtue of Sections 12, 13, 14 or 15 of the Irish Sale of Goods Act 1893 (as amended).

General:
    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland.  The local language version of this agreement shall apply to Software downloaded in the EU.
